## Introduction

This project showcases the integration of the Matter.js physics engine with an HTML5 audio player to create an engaging simulation of a dancing flamingo. The soft bodies of the flamingo are influenced by dynamic gravity and animated parameters, providing an interactive and visually interesting experience.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) - A 2D physics engine for the web.
- Web Audio API - Used for audio playback.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting the live demo.

## Demo

Explore the live demo of the project at [Physics - Dancing Flamingo](https://dhrub006.github.io/PhysicsDancingFlamingo/).

## Clone

To get started with the project locally, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DHRUB006/PhysicsDancingFlamingo.git
```

## Installation

No specific installation is required for this project. Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to experience the dancing flamingo simulation. If you wish to customize or extend the project, you may want to set up a local development environment.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Uncomment the `player.play()` line in the JavaScript code if you want to activate the background music.
3. Interact with the simulation by clicking and dragging the flamingo using the mouse.
